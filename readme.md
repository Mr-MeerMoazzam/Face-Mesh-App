# Project Summary: Face Mesh App Using MediaPipe

This repository contains the code for a Face Mesh App developed using MediaPipe and Streamlit. The goal of this project is to utilize MediaPipe's Face Mesh technology to perform facial landmark detection and visualization in real-time.

The app provides two modes of operation: image processing and video processing. In image processing mode, users can either upload their own images or use demo images provided within the app. The algorithm detects faces in the image and overlays a mesh of facial landmarks, allowing users to visualize and analyze the facial structure.

For video processing, users have the option to use their webcam for live face mesh detection or upload their own videos. The algorithm processes each frame of the video, detecting and visualizing facial landmarks in real-time. The processed video can also be recorded for further analysis.

The app offers a range of customizable parameters, including the maximum number of faces to detect, minimum detection confidence, and minimum tracking confidence. These parameters allow users to fine-tune the algorithm based on their specific needs and achieve optimal results.

The code is implemented using Python and makes use of libraries such as Streamlit, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and NumPy. Streamlit is used to create the interactive user interface, while MediaPipe provides the face mesh functionality. OpenCV is utilized for image and video processing tasks, and NumPy is used for array manipulation and calculations.

This project not only demonstrates the capabilities of face landmark detection but also serves as a practical example of integrating computer vision algorithms into user-friendly applications. By sharing this code on GitHub, I aim to contribute to the open-source community and provide a valuable resource for individuals interested in facial landmark detection and MediaPipe.

Please feel free to explore the code repository and contribute to its development. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Together, we can further enhance the capabilities of this Face Mesh App and advance the field of computer vision.
